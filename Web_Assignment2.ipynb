       " 'This is my first ever I phone. Before this I was using my google nexus 5. But moving from android to iOS is a great experience. It’s worth at this price. I will highly recommend it if you want to move to iOS. The best part of this phone is it’s camera and it’s battery life. This two things have won my heart. I loved it. Happy to have it in my hand. Still exploring its features. And can’t forget to mention Flipkart service. Very prompt service and fast delivery.',\n",
       " 'Well you all know the specifications . One of a kind. Best iPhone till date. Many enhancements to the camera app with many options. Love the glass body with matte finish in the lens area on the back. Lovely colours to choose from. Best battery in an iPhone till date, enough to last more than a day in normal usage. I tested my iPhone 11 battery and lasted for than 24 hours after full charge still with 30% battery charge left. Watched movies for some time. Normal usage on calls, browsing, musi...',\n",

But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy. 1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS. Now I want to shar...',\n",

       " 'First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone. And I recommend this phone and seller as well.\\n\\nAnd I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days.',\n",

The lcd display is also good.. but difference come when we watch movie in prime and Netflix, the colours are not vibrant.. as we see in amoled display.. and the charger in box is of 5 watts.. takes more than 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100.. so guys be prepare to buy 18 watts charger .

       " 'Reviewing again after 5 months. At the beginning the battery and performance was good but it degraded soon. Also I was facing heating issues. The mobile will heat up like a stove sometimes. You cannot even play Pubg even in low settings properly, performance is not a problem but heating is. Also if you play that game for 10 mins the brightness will be automatically down due to over heating even when the auto brightness is set to off. This will not be solved even if u manually increase the bri...',\n",
       " 'Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.\\n\\nP.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black',\n",

If you are using XR then still you can hold on for sometime and upgrade to 2020 model else this phone is a must buy . Camera quality is amazing and wide angle is something to count upon. Performance wise it’s amazing and feels premium while holding in hand. So a big YES for this device.

The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.\\nIf you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.\\nCameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look.
